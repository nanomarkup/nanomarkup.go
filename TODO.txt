Implement the following functions

- func Compact(dst *bytes.Buffer, src []byte) error
  Compact appends to dst the JSON-encoded src with insignificant space characters elided.

- func MarshalIndent(v any, prefix, indent string) ([]byte, error)
  MarshalIndent is like Marshal but applies Indent to format the output. Each JSON element in the output will begin on a new line beginning with prefix followed by one or more copies of indent according to the indentation nesting.
