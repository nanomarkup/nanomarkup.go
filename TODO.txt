Implement the following functions

- func Compact(dst *bytes.Buffer, src []byte) error
  Compact appends to dst the JSON-encoded src with insignificant space characters elided.

- func Indent(dst *bytes.Buffer, src []byte, prefix, indent string) error
  Indent appends to dst an indented form of the JSON-encoded src. Each element in a JSON object or array begins on a new, indented line beginning with prefix followed by one or more copies of indent according to the indentation nesting. The data appended to dst does not begin with the prefix nor any indentation, to make it easier to embed inside other formatted JSON data. Although leading space characters (space, tab, carriage return, newline) at the beginning of src are dropped, trailing space characters at the end of src are preserved and copied to dst. For example, if src has no trailing spaces, neither will dst; if src ends in a trailing newline, so will dst.

- func MarshalIndent(v any, prefix, indent string) ([]byte, error)
  MarshalIndent is like Marshal but applies Indent to format the output. Each JSON element in the output will begin on a new line beginning with prefix followed by one or more copies of indent according to the indentation nesting.

- func Valid(data []byte) bool
  Valid reports whether data is a valid JSON encoding.
